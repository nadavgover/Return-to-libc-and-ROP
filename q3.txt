Using ROP we were able to manipulate auth and make it 1.
My stack is practically is with this code (the stack is full with addresses but practically this is the idea):

pop eax
addresses.AUTH  # eax = address of auth

pop edx
-1  # edx = -1

inc edx
inc edx  # edx = 1

mov [eax], edx  # auth = 1

address of original return value of check password function


I used the search engine to find all the addresses, I chose to use it without the format funcions because it was easier to implement.
The format find functions were used by me for checking if a gadget exists.
I chose to put a condition to the find function, the condition is checking wether an address has a null byte or not.
This is important because if it has a null byte the strcmp will stop copying and we won't be able to exploit the vulnerability.
Putting it all together we managed to make auth=1 and to print victory.
