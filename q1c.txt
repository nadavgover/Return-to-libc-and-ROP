We found the address of exit as before by using gdb's command print exit.
This returned an address inside libc.
Now all we needed to do is to replace the junk from the previous question with the address of exit and after the address of /bin/sh we put the exit code as exit expects its argument there.
The program did not crash because exit does not return to ra as most functions do.
